      <p>Greetings.

If you are reading this, there’s a good chance that you came here via the QR code on one of fifty Turbopause shipping boxes, the very first boxes we had constructed.

Those fifty boxes contain the first garments I sewn under the Turbopause label. We are hoping that the sales from them will cover our start-up costs, mainly our two sewing machines and all the costs behind making bespoke fabrics. And then we’ll use that money to fund the next project, which I have already begun to design. I bought a book called “The World Orchid Stamps”, which is full of amazing examples of pre-Internet era stamps. Turbopause is a voyage of sorts, one that me and my family are going on, one that requires a certain level of faith that the destination exists and can be reached. We need the orchid stamps for that.

If you’re one of the owners of the contents of one of those cardboard boxes, I want to express my thanks to you. You are part of the first people to back me, Mami and Shiqi. It is my hope that the contents of the box will also aid you on your voyage, wherever it may be. And I hope that the winds behind our sails let us cross paths one day.
